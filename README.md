# Car Catalog
It's my first OOP C++ Console Application Project.
Created to learn and implement knowlegde of OOP C++ and Data Structures.

Project is Car Catalog <i>(Opel Brand)</i> for console interface with Polish interface.
The idea was to create a simple system for car seller.

Input and output data are .txt files.
User navigates with Menu.

Application allows user to:
- search models by criteria, 
- leasing calculations,
- check car's equipment,
- create new purchase order <i>(saved in .txt file)</i>.

Data structures used in the project are Linked List and Tree.
